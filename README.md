# Why this repo ?

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate an implementation of a basic todo app with an emphasis on :
- Solid and readable Redux architecture with [immer.js](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction)
- TypeScript as used in companies (entities + store typing)

The architecture may seem overkill for the feature scope of a basic todo app, but it shows how I scale complex front end applications with 30+ complex entities in my daily job.
